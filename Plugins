Suspended Plugins
Distribution of the following plugins was suspended in conjunction with the publication of a security advisory announcing unresolved security issues. The Jenkins security team believes that most use cases would be negatively impacted by these security vulnerabilities and it is better for the Jenkins ecosystem to no longer distribute these plugins in their current form to prevent harm to users. This typically is the case when plugins have particularly severe security vulnerabilities, deliberately bypass or disable protection mechanisms, or offer little benefit to users anyway.

Unless the security issue is inherent to what the plugin does while not making this the sole purpose of the plugin, the Jenkins security team welcomes efforts to fix the vulnerabilities and have plugin distribution restored.

In addition to plugins suspended for security reasons, the following plugins that require suspended plugins to run are also suspended, as they would not be installable:
